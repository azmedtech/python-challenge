#Purpose

Complete two activities: PyBank and PyPoll. 

PyBank requires the creation of a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company, based on the financial dataset called budget_data.csv. 

PyBank requires the creation of a Python script to analyze the election results for a small, rural town, based on the cadidate dataset called election_data.csv.

#Activity Details

-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
